	<h2><p style="font-size:30px;" align="center"><i><u>(For details refer to section title "Risk Factors" of page 41 of the RHP)</u></i></p></h2>
	<p class="big">&#9830; <u>Geographical Concentration Risk:</u> Our stores are concentrated in the eastern parts of India, and we generated a majority of our sales from our stores in West Bengal, Odisha, Assam and Bihar. 
	The contribution of the stores in Core Markets to our total revenue from operations for Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively were 87.32%, 90.50% and 91.44%.</p>
	<p class="big">&#9830; <u>Product Concentration Risk:</u> Our business is currently highly concentrated onour apparel product category. The contribution of apparels to the revenue from operations for Fiscals 
	2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively were 83.80%, 85.61% and 86.94%.</p>
	<p class="big">&#9830; <u>Private Label Risk:</u> We currently own 10 private label brands. We may launch additional brands and labels in the future across product categories, in order to effectively market such offerings. 
	However, we cannot assure you that any new labels or brands launched by us will be preferred by our customers or retail partners over our existing products, or that we will be able to recover costs or 
	achieve profitability associated with developing such labels and brands. The contribution of our private label brands to our revenue from operations for Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively were 37.93%, 31.43% and 24.72%.</p>
	<p class="big">&#9830; Our Company will not receive any proceeds from the Offer for Sale.</p>
	<p class="big">&#9830; <u>Competition Risk:</u> We operate in the highly competitive industry which is characterised by swift shifts in consumer trends and technology, which may lead to an adverse impact on our market 
	share at any time due to the significant number of competitors in our industry that may compete more effectively than us. We are a value fashion retailer with a market share of 3.03%, 2.22% and 2.45% in 
	the organised value retail market (lifestyle and home) in the states of West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, respectively as per the Technopak Report.</p>
	<p class="big">&#9830; <u>Brand Risk:</u>The use of "Style Baazar" or similar trade names or images by third parties may result in loss of business to such third parties, and any potential negative publicity relating 
	to such third parties may adversely affect our reputation, the goodwill of our brand and business prospects.</p>
	<p class="big">&#9830; <u>Expansion Risk:</u> The growth of our business depends on our ability to identify, obtain and retain quality retail spaces and our ability to effectively implement and manage our retail network. 
	As on March 31, 2024, we had 162 stores across 86 districts in 9 states. The number of stores closed by our Company in Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively were 6, 5 and 3.
	<p class="big">&#9830; <u>Fire Risk:</u> Our operations are exposed to the risk of fire accidents which could result in significant financial loss, property damage, interruption of our business operations and potential personal 
	injury or loss of life. In May 2024, a fire accident occurred at our erstwhile warehouse located at J.L No. 11, Prospace Industrial Parks, Mouza - Belumilki, Pearapur Gram Panchayat, Sreerampur District, 
	Hooghly-712 223, West Bengal causing loss of inventory stored in the warehouse.</p>
	<p class="big">&#9830; <u>Financial Risk:</u> We have incurred losses in the past. For Fiscal 2022, loss after tax was (80.07) million. Additionally, we have low PAT margins. Any losses in the future or continued sustenance 
	of low PAT margins may adversely impact our operations and financial conditions and the trading price of our Equity Shares. Our PAT margins for Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were 2.23%, 0.64% and (1.43)%.</p>
	<p class="big">&#9830; <u>Repeat Sales Risk:</u> Our future growth depends on our ability to continue to attract purchases from new customers and existing customers. The contribution of repeat sales to total gross sales 
	for Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were 71.94%, 70.00% and 68.50%.</p>
